# Bike Rental Demand Prediction
## Project Overview  
    This project focuses on analyzing and predicting Bike Rental Demand using machine learning techniques.
    Accurate demand prediction helps bike-sharing companies optimize bike availability,reduce operational costs
    and improve customer satisfaction.
    This project includes exploratory data analysis,data processing,feature engineering,model building,model evaluation to       predict number of bike rentals based on historical and environmental factors.

## Problem statement
  Bike rental demand varies based on factors such as:  
- Weather conditions
- Seasonality  
- Temperature
-  Holidays and Working days  
The goal is to build a machine learning model that can **accurately predict bike rental counts** using these features.

## Dataset Description
   The dataset contains historical bike rental data with the following features:
- Date and time information
- Temperature,humidity and wind speed
- Season and weather conditions
- Holiday and working day indicators
- Target variable:**Number of bike rentals**

    1.Data Loading & Cleaning 
    2.Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
        - Trends and seasonlity analysis  
        - Correlation analysis
    3.Feature Engineering
    4.Model Building   
        - Regression models for demand prediction    
    5.Model Evaluation
        - Performance metrics(R²,RMSE)    
    6.Results & Insights

## Model Performance
 Gradientboosting is best performing model gives R²=0.89 accuracy.

## key Insights:
   ⦁	Bike rentals increase during favorable weather conditions.  
   ⦁	Seasonal trends have a strong impact on demand.  
   ⦁	Working days show different rental patterns compared to holidays.
